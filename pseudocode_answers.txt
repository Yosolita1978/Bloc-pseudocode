Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A. To clarify ideas. If you write the steps of the one instruction, step by step, you'll resolve the problem, or at least figure out what part you don't understand clearly.
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A. It will throw an error. Pseudocode is just English-like statements. It will not compute in any programming language.

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
Input first number
Input second number
Check if the first number is greater than second.
If it's print the first number
If it not print the second number


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
Input a list of numbers from 1 to 100.
Iterate the list using a for loop so:
For every number in the list, print it

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
Input a object with the data from the phonebook
Input the specific entry we are looking For
Iterate for the dictionary until you find the entry

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function searchObj (obj, query) {

    for (var key in obj) {
        var value = obj[key];

        if (value === query) {
            console.log('I found the query);
            return value;
        }

    }

}
